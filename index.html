                            The cataloguing of information about the traditional uses of plants has long been an extractive and violent project of empire.
                            The earliest record of European indigenous plant use is of a military doctor, Dioscorides, who accompanied the Roman army as they pillaged across the countryside to erase or engulf anything in their path.  Locally, the textbooks of the Eclectic Herbal Doctors of 19th and 20th century Turtle Island contain vast empirical clinical records of medicinal use of native plants.  These doctors, a conservative reformist wing of the 19th century Popular Health Movement, remain whisper-quiet about the likely sources of their information, within the context of an epoch-defining indigenous genocide.  Today, American scientists and pharmaceutical industry reps comb through what's left of distant forests, in search of rare species in profitably-limited supply, to sell as extracts to the sick and dying at the highest price the richest of them can afford.

                            Understanding old ways of working with plants within the Amerikkkan Empire, without yourself indulging in its extractive tradition, is difficult and the ways out tend to be dead ends.  Re-constructing a pre-empire ethnic identity to authentically draw from, without a lineage-based connection to ancestral knowledge, is at best a mild comfort and at worst a distracting LARP.  For the few colonized people who are connected to living lineages without obstacles of distance, time, and relationship... the social context is missing.  Health was not always, everywhere, brandished as a mercenary weapon, with a threat to allow suffering to continue unless money exchanges hands.

                            It's here that we find each other, afraid and chronically ill in a dying empire, and make a way out.
